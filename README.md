# Kabomu Library for NodeJS

This is a port of the Kabomu library originally written in C#.NET to the NodeJS platform.

In a nutshell, Kabomu enables building quasi web applications that can connect endpoints within localhost and even within an OS process, through IPC mechanisms other than TCP.

It is like [node-ipc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ipc) but focuses on localhost,
easier transition to http, and ease of porting to other programming languages.

See the [repository for the .NET version](https://github.com/aaronicsubstances/cskabomu) for more details.
